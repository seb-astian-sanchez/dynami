Weightlifting Program Assistant

This program, like all things, I'd resist to say was written/created by a single person. When someone creates some type of work, even if they were the one wielding the tools, someone had to invent the tools! Anyway, it was written by Sebastian Sanchez as a sort of alternative to the other weight tracking programs I found:

-pen and paper
-text-editor on the mac
-strengthlevel

to be fair that was about it haha, but using Google I can for instance find another site called Jefit which is an app that basically does everything I'd like this to do, but it is beside the point.

In trying to get into exercise, more specifically lifting weights, there are some quirks that seem apparent on fitness websites and in fitness culture in general. I really hesitate to say anything negative about fitness culture, apart from of course the racket that the supplement business may be or crossfit criticism you've heard before, since I do think it's a domain of human activity with more optimism and inclusion therein than most others.

But I have a real hankering for simplicity and beauty. And I think the notion that I even have such a preference comes from what I'd like to call an ethic, or values. This is my attempt to build something that is nice on the eyes, doesn't demand much from the user, and in fact, provides information that is affirmative in persuasion and evocative in presentation. I don't think personal and biometrical data really needs to exist in this sort application. I definitely think there is a market for that and in some circles perhaps a preference for some progress-tracking method which takes that into account. However,
at the gym and in life generally, the process goes about a person taking a notebook out and making notes, maybe they'd put them into a spreadsheet later, read some academic papers on a website, and over time conjecture about how their biometrics influence their progress.

Take for instance the influence of sleep, diet, and stress on recovery. These are just some of the confounding variables taken along with individual conjectures that give me the impression that all we really need to do is write the numbers down and look at the lines, since we are the true experts of their context. Just graphs and numbers make interesting patterns, which we may not at first think mean anything but opening the door to possibilities simply by tinkering (Nassim Taleb), is I believe a more promising direction if we are to extend any further beyond tabulation in our endeavour to keep track of progress.

So I would concede also that my experience in consuming music and trying to create music has influenced my motivations. That is, for instance the way we use polar curves in a wave-table synthesizer or how many popular music artists tend to have a "self-reactionary" white album phase. We can shift our perspective a little bit and in that make changes oblique to our usual methods. We also find that after the realization of some major ambition or dream, it is perhaps a return to simplicity that we crave.  Before enlightenment, carry water, After enlightenment, carry water.
